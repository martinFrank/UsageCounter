# UsageCounter

a small app that lets you count things, i mostly use it for my toothpaste to see how much uses i can squeeze out of one tube - and since i always forget how much i previously used i wrote this app

you can use it to count down as well, you can simply adjust the counter to the start value and count down from there, maybe if you want to keep track of your package of 200er tictacs.

# new feature: provide a graph

you can now keep track on the time stamps of your counter.
